# PykCharts.js

[PykCharts.js](http://pykcharts.com) is a well designed d3.js charting without the complexity of d3.js. It includes 26+ well-designed, themeable, responsive, modular, real-time and easy to use charts and 109+ maps.

**Focus on Design:** The primary goal of a chart is to communicate data. Everything else is secondary! We have put in a lot of care to get the basics right for every chart and set them as defaults so you avoid common data visualisation mistakes right from the start.

**Smart defaults:** We originally built this charting library so our developers could get charts up very quickly.  The API is simple enough for someone with minimum knowledge of HTML, CSS and JS to get started.  

**Comprehensive overrides:** Then designers would override the defaults to custom design the charts and make the final dashboard extremely intuitive for readers. Experts can override almost every single aspect. Alternatively, you can use the [Live Editor](http://pykcharts.com/tour/pie) to visually override the configuration.
